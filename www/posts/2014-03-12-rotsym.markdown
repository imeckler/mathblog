title: Rotationally Symmetric Shapes
---

Some shapes have **rotational symmetry**. By a rotational symmetry,
I mean an angle that the shape can be rotated by to get the same shape
(we will make this more precise later).
For example, consider a
square. You can rotate it by four different angles to get the same shape.

<div id="square" class="illustration"></div>

More generally, a regular $n$-gon 
(a shape with $n$ sides of the same length and $n$ equal angles)
has $n$ rotational symmetries. 

What about a shape with infinitely many rotational symmetries?
There is a simple example of such a shape that shouln't be too
difficult to think of, but I'll let you try and think of it yourself.

Now, if we want to find out what kinds of shapes have infinitely many
rotational symmetries, we have to make a few things precise:

- What do we mean by shape?
- What exactly is a rotational symmetry?

# Shape

It is a bit difficult to say what the defining characteristics of the intuitive
notion of a "shape" are. Here are some that seem reasonable:

- It can be described by a collection of points in the plane
- It shouldn't "go on forever", that is, I should be able to draw a box
  around it.
- It shouldn't have any "discontinuities".

Let's fix some notation. First off, $\mathbb{R}^2$ refers to the collection
of points $(x, y)$, where $x$ and $y$ are real numbers.
Think of it as specifying a point in the plane, as below.
