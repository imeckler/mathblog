This is my blog of proofs with accompanying clarifying animations. The animations are
generated using my [animation library](https://github.com/imeckler/compellingproof)
and my [FRP library](https://github.com/imeckler/ocamlfrp).

The proof I'm currently working on animating proves the theorem
"Any continuous curve in the plane with infinitely many rotational symmetries is
an annulus".

You can see the animations described in `rotsym.ml` [here](http://jsfiddle.net/k3fsw/).
