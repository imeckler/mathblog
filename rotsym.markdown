Some shapes have **rotational symmetry**. By a rotational symmetry,
I mean an angle that the shape can be rotated by to get the same shape
(we will make this more precise later).
For example, consider a
square. You can rotate it by four different angles to get the same shape.

<div id="square" class="illustration"></div>

More generally, a regular $n$-gon 
(a shape with $n$ sides of the same length and $n$ equal angles)
has $n$ rotational symmetries. 

What about a shape with infinitely many rotational symmetries?
**Mention circle**

Now if we want to solve this problem, we have to make a few things precise.
- What do we mean by shape?
- What exactly is a rotational symmetry?

# Shape

It is a bit difficult to say what the defining characteristics of the intuitive
notion of a "shape" are. Here are some that seem reasonable:
- It can be described by a collection of points in the plane
- It shouldn't "go on forever", that is, I should be able to draw a box
  around it.
- It shouldn't have any "discontinuities".
